    Use the device_code and poll at the interval (in seconds) to check if the user has authorized you app.
    Use expires_in to stop polling after that many seconds, and gracefully instruct the user to restart the process.
    It is important to poll at the correct interval and also stop polling when expired.
    When you receive a 200 success response, save the access_token so your app can authenticate the user in methods
    that require it. The access_token is valid for 3 months. Save and use the refresh_token to get a new
    access_token without asking the user to re-authenticate. Check below for all the error codes that you should
    handle.
